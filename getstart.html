    <h1>BEGINNER’S WORKOUT AT A GLANCE</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Week 1</b>: Full-body split<br>
        <b>Week 2</b>: Two-day split: Upper body/Lower body<br>
        <b>Week 3</b>: Three-day split: Push/Pull/Legs<br>
        <b>Week 4</b>: Four-day split: Full body<br>

    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">WEEK 1: WHOLE IN ONE</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 900px; font-size: 20px; margin-top:24px;">
        You’ll begin the program with a full-body training split, meaning you’ll train all major bodyparts in each
        workout (as opposed to “splitting up” your training). Train three days this first week, performing just one
        exercise per bodypart in each session. It’s important that you have a day of rest between each workout to allow
        your body to recover; this makes training Monday, Wednesday and Friday—with Saturday and Sunday being rest
        days—a good approach.

        The exercises listed in Week 1 are a collection of basic moves that, while also used by advanced lifters, we
        feel are suitable for the beginner as well. Notice we’re not starting you off with only machine exercises; a
        handful of free-weight movements are present right off the bat. Reason being, these are the exercises you need
        to master for long-term gains in muscular size and strength, so you may as well start learning them now.
        Carefully read all exercise descriptions before attempting them yourself.

        In Week 1 you’ll perform three sets of every exercise per workout, which over the course of the week adds up to
        nine sets total for each bodypart, a good starting volume for your purposes. With the exception of crunches for
        abs, you’ll do 8–12 reps per set. This rep scheme is widely considered ideal for achieving gains in muscle size
        (the scientific term is hypertrophy) and is commonly employed by amateur and pro bodybuilders alike.

    <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">WEEK 2: SPLIT DECISION</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 900px; font-size: 20px; margin-top:24px;">
        You’re only a week into the program, yet you’ll begin to train different bodyparts on different days with a
        two-day training split (meaning the entire body is trained over the course of two days, rather than one as in
        the first week). You’ll train a total of four days this week; the split includes two upper-body days (Monday and
        Thursday) and two lower-body days (Tuesday and Friday), and each bodypart is trained twice. Wednesday, Saturday
        and Sunday will be your recovery days.

        Several exercises from Week 1 are carried over to Week 2, but one move is added to each bodypart routine—with
        the exception of abs—so you can train all muscle groups more completely from multiple angles. Chest, for
        example, includes two exercises: One is a compound movement (dumbbell bench press) that involves multiple joints
        (both the shoulder and elbow) to work the largest amount of muscle possible, and the other is an isolation
        exercise (dumbbell flye) that involves only one joint (shoulder) and targets the pecs to a greater extent. (When
        doing presses for chest, the deltoids and triceps are involved to a degree, meaning presses don’t isolate the
        pecs as much as flyes do.)
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">WEEK 3: THREE ON THREE</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 900px; font-size: 20px; margin-top:24px;">

        In the third week of the program we step it up to a three-day training split: Train all “pushing” bodyparts
        (chest, shoulders, triceps) on Day 1; hit the “pulling” bodyparts (back, biceps) and abs on Day 2; and work your
        lower body (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves) on Day 3. As in Week 2, you train each bodypart twice a week, so
        you’ll hit the gym six days this week.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:20px;">WEEK 4: TURNING UP THE VOLUME</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 900px; font-size: 20px; margin-top:24px;">
        In the fourth and final week of the program, you’ll train four days in a four-way split that hits each bodypart
        just once (except for calves and abs, which are each trained twice). Four-day splits are common among
        experienced lifters because they involve training fewer bodyparts (typically 2–3) per workout, which gives each
        muscle group ample attention and allows you to train with higher volume. As you’ll see, chest and triceps are
        paired up, as are back with biceps and quads with hamstrings, each a very common pairing among novice and
        advanced bodybuilders. Shoulders are trained more or less on their own, and you’ll alternate hitting calves and
        abs—which respond well to being trained multiple times per week—every other workout. No new exercises are
        introduced in Week 4 so that you can focus on intensity in your workouts instead of learning new movements.
